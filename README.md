# Covid-19 Data Analysis

## Overview

The **Covid-19 Data Analysis** project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to uncover insights and trends related to the pandemic. This repository contains scripts and notebooks for data collection, preparation, analysis, and visualization.

## Objectives

- Analyze COVID-19 data to track the progression of the pandemic.
- Visualize trends and patterns in infection rates, recovery rates, and death rates.
- Provide insights and predictions to aid decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Scripts for collecting COVID-19 data from various sources.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Descriptive and time series analysis of the data.
- **Visualization**: Interactive and static charts to represent data trends.
- **Predictive Modeling** (Optional): Forecasting future trends based on historical data.

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, IDEs (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arvindselvamoorthy15/Covid-19-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Covid-19-Data-Analysis
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Data Collection:**
   - The `data_collection.py` script collects data from various sources. Ensure you have the necessary API keys or credentials if required.

4. **Data Preparation:**
   - Use the `data_preparation.py` script to clean and preprocess the data.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   - Run the analysis scripts located in the `analysis/` directory to explore and analyze the data.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations using the scripts in the `visualizations/` directory.

7. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Optionally, use the `predictive_modeling.py` script to forecast future trends based on the data.

## Usage

- **Scripts**: Run individual scripts from the command line or within a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Notebooks**: Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data interactively.
